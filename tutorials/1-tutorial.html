        <h3 class="panel-title">Application Scenario</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>
      Suppose we wish to develop a software application that allows users to
      track and categorize their spending habits. Since it may not be
      connected to any particular bank, let's say users are able to link their
      debit or credit cards to this web portal. Then all the transactions will
      appear on this website in some way. This software is meant to be useful
      for a wide variety of users. For example, high school students who have
      part time jobs and allowances may be one user group, and full time
      working adults between the age of 30-45 may be another user group.
      <pre><code>int a = 7;
            public static void main(String args[]) {
              // Some amazing code, obviously
            }
      </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Task 1:</strong> 
      Identify a third user group for this application. Once you have it,
      create a persona for your user group and a persona for one of the user
      groups mentioned above. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Task 2:</strong> 
      Suppose you named your two personas Jack and Jill. Separately, enumerate
      at least two user goals that Jack and Jill may have in using this
      software, at least two of each user skills and preferences that Jack and
      Jill may have that would influence how the software should be designed..
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Task 3:</strong> 
      After that, build a user scenario for each of
      the two personas. Your user scenarios should illustrate how differently
      the two personas are motivated to use the software application. Since
      the software has not been built, you may assume the software can have
      any meaningful features needed to achieve the necessary user goals.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Task 4:</strong> 
	  Finally, consider how the two personas differ in the ways they use the
	  software. Now, imagine a particular design for the software where the
	  two personas can use the software to carry out a task (e.g., view types
	  of transactions, or view spending limits by category, or forecast
	  achievable financial goal). Come up with a software design and a task
	  such that the design would work well for one persona but would work
	  poorly for the other. Explain why that is the case.

          A new user group has been identified but it overlaps too much with
          the existing user groups. 
          The persona description mentions some characteristics of a person
          typical of that user group. Description is too heavily focused on
          technology.

          <td>[2]<br>
          A clearly distinct user group has been identified. 
          Persona has a name, and clearly illustrates the characteristics of a
          person typical of that user group. Description does not mention the
          technology being designed.

          The user scenarios do not provided added context of use for the
          software being designed. The two user scenarios do not differ much
          from each other.
          </td>
          <td>[2]<br> 
          User scenarios demonstrate how the two persona are motivated
          differently to use the software being designed. Both scenarios also
          illustrate how the two personas would use the technology
          differently.
