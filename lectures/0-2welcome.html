    <p>
    Welcome to the course! 
    </p>
    <p>
    This course is a core Computer Science course typically taken in the third
    year of a four-year degree. This year, the course is run <span
	class=hl-blue>partially asynchronously</span> (I will explain more on what
    that means soon). This lecture will give you an
    overview of the content that you can expect from this course. There will
    be a mix of content pages (like this one), videos, quizzes, activities,
    and assignments. I will also walk you through how the course is
    structured.
    </p>
	<p>
	These pages will be split up into sections. To view the next section,
	click "Continue" below.

    <div class="content-section">
    <h2>Separated Reading Content</h2>
	<p>
	When no more content is left on the page, and you click "Continue", it
	will ask you to download a log file. Make sure to download this, and store
	it with the other log files you have for the other pages of this module.
	Once you have all the log files for a module, submit it for participation
	marks. 
	</p>
	<p>
	These log files are meant to help us determine what worked well and didn't
	with the content designed in this course. Your help is much appreciated!
