2,What doe HCI stand for?,Human Computer Interaction,~Human Computer Interfaces,Haphazard Counter Interference
2,Is HCI all about making pretty looking software?,"To some extent - there is certainly an element of HCI that involves having a good interface look and feel, but the core of HCI is about the interaction.","Yes, making software look pretty makes users feel good and so the software will definitely be more useful.","No, HCI has nothing to do with interface aesthetics."
3,"If a rich person wants to pay you to design software for seniors, what would be the best choice for input interaction?","Depends how old these people are (which dictates how stable their hands are), what the software is used for, and how the seniors want to use the software.","Always a touchscreen, because it is easier than using a mouse and keyboard.","It doesn't matter, most seniors don't know how to use software well anyway so you can just design something and get them to learn what you have. (Yikes! Don't expect to be hired.)"
3,What does it mean if a novel input mechanism has an extra degree of freedom than an existing input mechanism?,It basically means the novel way allows the user to do a lot more with an extra dimension of input.,It means the novel way lets the user do what is desired to get the job done.,It means the novel way allows the user to do one extra action than it was possible with the existing way.
4,"Suppose you came up with solution A that is cheap to build and scalable, but looks bad and clunky (i.e., unnatural), versus solution B that has awesome aesthetics, can save user time and effort in carrying out tasks, but is super expensive. Which solution should you choose?","Depends, not every solution can meet the design criteria. So the designer has to weigh the various criteria involved and make appropriate design tradeoffs that will work best for the target user population.",Pick the solution with awesome aesthetics because that's all most people care about.,"Pick the solution that is cheap to build because you can make a ton of those and sell them for cheap, so eventually you'll have enough users and you'll make the money back."
5,What do researchers in the field of user modeling work on?,"They create formal models of users (often probabilistic models) and estimate information about these users that is otherwise not known to us. Such information can be how well a user knows math (in a tutoring software), how receptive a user is to automated hints (in an assistive software), how often a user uses function x over y (in a work productivity software), etc.",They build sculptures of people who use software.,They take photographs of people posing funny pictures while using software.
6,HCI is all about pretty software and fluffy concepts. Is this correct?,"There are certainly some vague concepts and subjective judgment, but the most important things to learn about HCI are the techniques, tools, and methods in the field. ","Yes, many students believe this so it must be true.","Yes, because I see a lot of words I don't understand on this page."
6,"If I follow the pre-established guidelines, I will definitely develop usable software. Is this statement true?","No. The problem is that sometimes the guidelines contradict each other in a certain situation, and you as the designer needs to make a choice. Sometimes the guidelines are too vague and you need to figure out what they mean for your particular situation. In general, results from usability testing are what tells you whether your software is usable.","Yes, those guidelines are tried and true afterall.","No, some guidelines are better than others."
7,Do I have to attend class during scheduled lecture and lab times?,You should if you want help with the course activities. They operate like office hours this year. We will not take attendance for marks.,"Yes, because I get marks if I attend class.","Yes, because I won't be given the material unless I go to class to get it."
8,Are the pre-tests done individually?,"Yes, individually.","No, you are supposed to do them in groups.",It depends on the module. Some pre-tests are individual and some are in groups.
8,Are the post-tests done individually?,"Yes, individually, but if we need to do them in pairs we can, and it won't be considered as cheating.","No, you always do them in groups.",It depends on the module. Some post-tests are individual and some are in groups.
9,"If I submit a tutorial activity 2 hours late, and it is potentially worth 10 marks, what is the maximum number of marks I can get on this late activity?",0,9,10
9,"I was sick on the day when post-test was closed on Canvas, so I couldn't write it on the last day. I didn't have time to write it on any of the days that the post-test was opened. Can the mark be waived if I give you a doctor's note?","No, unfortunately, we must follow the class policy for everyone. Therefore, unless your medical note indicates that you were sick on ALL the days that the post-test was opened, then we cannot waive that mark.","Yes, since you were sick that one day and didn't have time the other days.","Yes, only because you asked nicely."
10,When does Module 1 start?,"As soon as you have completed the post-test of the practice module (on the next page), the content for Module 1 will unlock. We want you to get to this point before next Monday so you don't fall behind.",When the instructor emails everyone in the class.,Next Monday.
